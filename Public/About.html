        My name is Sashwat Sridhar, I am a third year Computer Engineering student at the University of Guelph.  
        I am eager to apply my academic knowledge and hands-on experience to contribute to the innovative projects in the Web Developement field. 
        Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in programming skills (C, Java, Matlab, MIPS assembly, ARM assembly, VHDL), 
        Solidworks, AutoCAD, and Microsoft Office. My coursework has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of problem-solving skills, data structures, 
        the analysis and design of computer algorithms, and operating systems. What distinguishes me is my excellent collaboration skills, 
        strong verbal and communication skills, and great multitasking skills.

        A few of my coding projects include creating a car rental company, 
        implementing a ticket system to register tickets for trains and buses 
        and making a program called Crypto Magic to encrypt or decrypt files depending on what the user inputs.  
        These projects have proven my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges.
    <br/>
    <br/>
        During my internship at Signland, I was responsible for printing and managing timely delivery schedules including projects with over 10,000 items, 
        demonstrating my problem-solving skills to find an efficient way of completing many tasks, independent work skills in a fast-paced environment with minimal supervision, 
        and self-motivation.

        Thank you for taking the time to read about me. 
        With my programming skills I hope to get a job at a leading technology firm where I can put my passion into my work
